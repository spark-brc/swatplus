      subroutine gwflow_canl_out !rtb gwflow

!!    ~ ~ ~ PURPOSE ~ ~ ~
!!    this subroutine calculates the water exchange volume between irrigation canals and connected grid cells
!!    for canals that originate outside of the model boundary (and hence do not remove water from channels
!!    within the model)
